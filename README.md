# VFZ QA Assessment


## Overview 

This repository contains solution to the assessment. 

The initial code base was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project based on [this](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/petstore-example/petstore-example/1.0.0#/) swagger hub API provided in the assessment test case. 

This is a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework. The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

When you run the app as a spring application, the swagger UI must be up and running at http://localhost:8080/petstore-example/petstore-example/1.0.0/swagger-ui/

## Assessment Output

a)  The code of a working pet store project

    1) PetApiController.java has been updated to implement the three pet methods POST/pet, PUT/pet and GET/pet/findByStatus
    2) Method implementations are very simple. They simply return Status 200 OK.

b)  With unit tests

    1) PetApiControllerTest.java contains unit tests for these three methods
    2) Unit tests are written with @SpringBootTest and @MockMVC
    3) Download this repo and run 'mvn clean verify' to build and run the unit tests

c) Postman collection for integration tests: [petstore.postman_collection.jason](https://github.com/Bookanakere/vfz-qa-assessment/tree/master/src/test/postman)

d) A flow diagram for the CI/CD pipeline: [3d-high-level-ci-cd-flow.png](https://github.com/Bookanakere/vfz-qa-assessment/tree/master/src/test/3d-high-level-ci-cd-flow.png)

e) Description of other tests: [3e-description-of-other-tests](https://github.com/Bookanakere/vfz-qa-assessment/blob/master/src/test/3e-description-of-other-tests.pdf)
